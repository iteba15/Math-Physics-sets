# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a fascinating simulation of cellular automata that was invented by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead, and evolve according to a simple set of rules based on the number of living neighbors each cell has. The game can produce complex and unpredictable patterns from simple initial configurations, and has been studied extensively by mathematicians, computer scientists, biologists, and hobbyists.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python 3 and some libraries, such as numpy, matplotlib, and pygame. You can install them using pip:
